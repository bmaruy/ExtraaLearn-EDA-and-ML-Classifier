# ExtraaLearn EDA and ML Classifier

## Project overview:
I analyzed a dataset of ExtraaLearn, an online education company, to determine the likelihood a user would become a potential buyer or not. I created a decision tree model and a random forest model to classify if a user would lead to a paying customer.

## Installation and setup:
- Language: Python 3.11.5
- Environment: Jupyter notebook
- Other dependencies: Other dependencies were installed in the Jupyter notebook (including numpy, pandas, scikit, seaborn, matplotlib).

## Data
 - Information regarding the data is inside the Jupyter notebook, and a data dictionary written by the datasetâ€™s creator is in the beginning of the notebook.

## Code structure:
 - Begins with an overview of ExtraaLearn and the dataset.
- This is followed by installing necessary dependencies and loading in the dataset.
- I then get a better understanding of the data before doing exploratory data analysis, using univariate and bivariate analysis to discover patterns or trends. 
- I then make the classification models (decision tree and random forest), and try to optimize both.
- I end it with a conclusion and possible future steps.

## Results and Evaluations
- I discovered the most impactful features for classifying if a user will become a paying customer. The random forest model achieved an accuracy of 86%. I also found possible areas for improvement that indicate a strong conversion rate in becoming a paying customer.
